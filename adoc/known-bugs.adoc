=== Error on console while booting with SELinux enabled

When booting the system with SELinux enabled, the console reports:

....
Failed to transition into init label 'system_u:system_r:init_t:s0'
....

This report has been analyzed and evaluated to be harmless.

=== Cockpit not known by firewalld

Firewalld does not know the Cockpit service.
As a workaround, open the port in firewall by typing this command:
....
firewall-cmd --zone=public --permanent --add-port=9090/tcp
....
